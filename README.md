Etch-A-Sketch Project
This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch web application that allows users to draw on a 16x16 grid of square divs. Each square changes its RGB color randomly upon interaction, and a progressive darkening effect is applied on hover, adding 10% more black or color to the square on each interaction.

How to Use
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
You will see a 16x16 grid of white squares on the screen.
Move your mouse over the squares to draw with random RGB colors and enjoy the progressive darkening effect.
To reset the grid and create a new sketch pad, click the "Reset Grid" button at the top of the screen.
A prompt will ask for the number of squares per side for the new grid (maximum 100).
Enter a valid number and click "OK" to generate a new grid within the same total space (960px wide).
